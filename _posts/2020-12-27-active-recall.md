### What is active recall?

Do you ever feel like you know something but when the time to explain it, you feel frustrated? For me, it is always the way it happens. The simple answer is you donâ€™t know it.

**Active recall** is a method to help remember things you learned into long-term memory. It questions your knowledge to help you see a gap between what you think you know and things you know.
